## Overall - 4/5
I recently finished "The Hike" by Drew Magary. Man was it a wild and crazy ride.This book is an easy to recommend summer read. It is light, fun, and really stretches your imagination. I must admit that as a 30 something Dad who shares a lot in common with the protagonist Ben it might be easier for me to relate to the protagonist than most might. If you are interested in surreal, not quite sci-fi but not *not* sci-fi books, than this might be up your alley.

## Synopsis
This book starts out with the classic, lost guy trying to get back to his family trope. I know that sounds boring, but *don't let this discourage you.* I agree that this isn't the most original plot device or even all that interesting of one but the *rules* of the universe are what makes this book so fun. Along Ben's journey, you discover the rules that govern this universe that Ben inhabits are significantly different than our own. The reason this book is so much fun is that the rules are consistent and can lead to some hilarious, terrifying, depressing, but always interesting situations. The book does take you through that roller-coaster of emotions (especially the part with the roller-coaster). I realize that this is an incomplete synopsis, but I don't want to ruin the journey for you! Go pick up a copy at your local bookstore and enjoy. Let me know what you think of the book.

## Analysis
I think that this book is a little inconsistent with it's emotional depth. At times, I think it really hits home some interesting fears, tramaus, and other things that some suburban raised American's can relate to. At other times, it falls flat and feels a little bit "forced" or "insincere". But those times are outnumbered and do not distract from the fun of the book. I do think that as a white, middle class, 30 year old that I will have a different perspective on these experiences. As I mentioned earlier I have shared several of these experiences with the protagonist. I think that women and minorities might feel differently about Ben but I certainly can relate. I am curious to see what others think about this book.
