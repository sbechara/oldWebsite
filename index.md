Welcome to the webpage for Dr.B (aka Samuel Bechara). On this page you can find personal information about me, tutorials I have created for students, my blog (which you really shouldn't care about), and other things I find interesting. The main page (*the one you are on now*) has my blog entries below. To navigagte the site, see the links in the top right corner of the page.
