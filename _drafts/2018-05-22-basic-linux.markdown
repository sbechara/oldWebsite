This is the first of a series of tutorials meant to get you in front of a LINUX command line interface (CLI) so you can navigate your computer in style. Who cares? CLIs seem more primitive than graphical user interfaces (GUI). While it is true that CLIs *did* come first it isn't true that they aren't as powerful or easy to use. It is true that they have a steeper learning curve, but once you have learned, you will be more efficient and productive when using a computer. However, the time commitment to get good is significant and you really need to dive in.

So enough of all that, I'll assume you are ready to get started on the CLI journey...

# How to get a LINUX CLI on your computer
There are a couple of different methods that I will split into two categories:
* Dangerous
* Not dangerous

The danger is to your files, **make sure you backup all your important data before continuing!** However, just because it is dangerous, doesn't mean that there aren't safe ways to proceed. Technically, flying 20,000ft in the sky in an aluminum box **is dangerous** but it is safe when done correctly. 

## Reccomended Method - Install Linux! (*but not for the faint of heart*)
