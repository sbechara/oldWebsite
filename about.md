## Teaching Experience
I have been teaching in one capacity or another since the Fall of 2012 and I have enjoyed *almost* every second of it. Sometimes it can be frustrating, but overall, I love my job and career.

As of Fall 2018, I have taught (or co-taught) and developed materials for the following courses 
(* indicates course had lab component):
* AP Physics B
* AP Physics C
* Algebra I
* Calculus I
* Introduction to Mechanical Engineering
* Introduction to Biomedical Engineering*
* Computing for Biomedical Engineers
* Numerical Methods with MATLAB
* Biomedical Instrumentation
* Biocomputer Design*


## Education

| 2008 - 2012 | Colorado State University | PhD Biomedical Engineering |

### Dissertation Synopsis

Dissertation synopsis: I independently created a multifunctional tissue-engineering scaffold by incorporating biological, chemical, and mechanical cues to optimize neural stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. I also mentored and guided undergraduate research assistants to further their career development and scientific training.

| 2005 - 2008 | Washington State University | B.S. Biomedical Engineering |

While an undergraduate I worked in the laboratory of Dr. David Lin where I developed signal detection algorithms to analyze muscle activation in hibernating grizzly bears. I also reviewed technical papers for publication.

## Experience

| 2017 - Present | Colorado State University | Assistant Professor of Practice |

* Courses taught include: Introduction to Engineering (MECH 103), Numerical Methods (MECH 105) and Senior Design (MECH 486A)
* Developed a “Muscle Car” summer camp where students combine an Arduino with electromyogram sensors to remotely control an RC car with their biceps.

| 2015 - 2017 | Marquette University | Assistant Chair and Lecturer |

* Courses taught include: Introduction to Biomedical Engineering (BIEN 1100), Computing for Biomedical Engineers (BIEN 1120), Biomedical Instrumentation (BIEN 4320), Biocomputers Design Lab (BIEN 4290)
* Developed three innovative laboratory experiences for freshman in Biomaterials
* Managed and coordinated the biomedical engineering graduate seminar series. Implemented live streaming of each seminar and created a repository on YouTube to archive old seminars
* Authored documentation and served on the executive guiding committee overseeing the merger with the Medical College of Wisconsin and the formation of a new joint-department
* Created and directed an outreach activity aimed at empowering High School students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Students were given tools, given materials, and were guided through the process of building electrocardiograms (ECG). At the conclusion of the event, students were allowed to keep their ECGs.

| 2013 - 2015 | Bellarmine Preparatory School | Science Faculty |

* Courses taught include: AP Physics B, AP Physics C
* Contributed to advancing the educational programs of robotics
* Served as the head coach of the FIRST Robotics League Team 360.
* Served on committee and guiding team leading the school through accreditation and organized accreditation materials

| 2012 - 2013 | Red Rocks Community College | Adjunct Mathematics Faculty |

* Courses taught include: Algebra I, Calculus I
* Created lectures and curriculum to maximize student involvement, interest, and learning.

| 2010 - 2012 | Hyperion Labs | Co-Founder |

* Working with business leaders in the area, co-founded a start-up company based on plasma etching research that was developed as a graduate student at Colorado State University
* Developed marketing strategies
* Created and managed company intellectual property

| 2008 - 2013 | Propel Labs | R&D Biomedical Engineer |

* Consulted on medical device development projects from a technical and commercial perspective while a graduate student
* Gained valuable industry experience about the entire medical device development process from alpha to release
* Developed, implemented, and documented quality assurance protocols to meet specific project milestones

## Teaching Awards

| 2014 | William Dahlgren Teaching Excellence Award |

The award is given to teachers in K-12 education that exemplify going above and beyond their role as educators. This means that a teacher engages students in the subject, probing beyond mere reciting of facts.

| 2014 | Anthony Falcone Teaching Excellence Award |

The award is based on evidenced ability to favorably influence students to pursue science, math and engineering fields of further study such as materials and processes.
